This is how to install sphinx: 

On a Mac: 

Download the sphinx zip file; I got mine from here: 
http://sphinx-doc.org/install.html

Unzip it somewhere. In the unzipped directory, do the following as
root, (sudo -i):

python setup.py build
python setup.py install

Another option (Mac/Unix/Windows): Use pip
* Unless you already have it, install pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html)
* run
    pip install sphinx



This is all you need. You should now be able to build HTML/pdf documentation from git sources locally. 

And this is how you build: 

make html

in this directory will generate html files, and leave them in the build subdirectory here. 
To have it build the html files AND deploy them under your glassfish environment, type

make htmldeploy

For this the Makefile assumes that your glassfish is in /usr/local/glassfish4.
If it's installed elsewhere, you need to specify the directory on the command line, 
for example, like this:

make htmldeploy DOCROOT=/Applications/NetBeans/glassfish-4.1/glassfish/domains/domain1/docroot

If you need more information on sphinx (probably not), for ex., on how to start a new
documentation project of your own, etc., here's a good link:

As always, Google is your friend. 

For a super useful quick start doc on how to format your source
documents in sphinx, remember to consult Eleni's ".rst cheat sheet":
