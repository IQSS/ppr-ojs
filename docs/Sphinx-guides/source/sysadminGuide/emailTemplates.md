# Email Templates
Several email templates are utilized on different workflows of the application, these can be configured by going from the main page to:

```
Settings > Activity > Emails > Email Templates
```

In this section you will be able to access, add new templates or modify existing ones that you will see are used on the code or through the application, these are referenced by the template name which will be an all-caps identifier separated by underscores, some of these names will start with `PPR_` and those will be the custom templates that have been created for the system. 

Each template will consist of the following fields:

- Subject
- Content

Each email template has its backend class.

## Adding an email template

We have to be careful when importing or adding text to email templates, the field that contains the email template accepts rich format text and copying text from some editors can cause issues when these are parsed.

For a list of all the email templates please [see](custom_email_templates).
