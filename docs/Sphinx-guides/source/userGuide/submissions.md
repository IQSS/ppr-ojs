# Submissions

Once logged in a user can access the Submissions screen, there you will be able to manage and create new submissions, this process has been modified to fit **PPR** needs.

## Creating a new Submission

The process of creating a submission is structured into 5 steps:

### Start

The first screen will present to the user a form that will inform about the requirements for the submission and also will let the user write some comments for the ``Editorial Committee``.

### Upload Submission

This is the section where the user will be able to upload files for their submission, as part of the customization with JavaScrip, this screen requires the user to upload a file before being able to continue.

### Enter Metadata

On the Metadata section the user will be able to define the metadata of the submission, this part has been customized to add a field named ``Research Document type`` which will help to pre-select the reviewer instructions. 

### Confirmation

This screen will show a summary of the submission, part of this screen was customized to include the options shown on the start screen

### Next Steps

The last part of the process will serve only as a confirmation that the submission has been completed, the message of this screen can be configured on OJS but a customized survey component has been added.
